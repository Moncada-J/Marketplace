# CropMart

CropMart is an online marketplace that connects a community, their gardens and their local farms. Where anyone can sell or 
buy produce from all kinds of fruits and vegetables. With the advancement of technology and automation, we believe
it's important to still have a sense of human connection and community. That's why we decided to build this platform 
where we can provide an interconnection for those involved.
